# What is this?

This is a collection of reasonably well thought out notes on xkb geometry that I'm calling documentation, because it's probably the best there is on the topic.

Xkb geometry is very powerful, but I haven't found any good documentation anywhere (I've searched hard, but please let me know if I didn't search hard enough).

This is for anyone else who has decided to ignore [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/X_keyboard_extension#xkb_geometry), but has otherwise followed that page, or something similar.


# List of geometry files, to use as templates/examples

- https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/xkeyboard-config (look in the geometry folder). Probably already in /usr/share/X11/xkb/ on your computer.
The default is the 105 key version in geometry/pc, but the other files have more complicated layouts.

- My Dell Latitude E6420 layout in the examples folder.

Random repos I found after a bit of searching:

- https://github.com/pfaion/x1carbon-xkb-geometry

- https://github.com/ZeptByteS/xkb_geometry_microsoft_4000

Please let me know if you find more.
I think it would be nice to have a good collection of keyboard geometry configuration files.
